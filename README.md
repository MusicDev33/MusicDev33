### Shelby McCowan

Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I'm just a dude that got started with game programming over a decade ago. I've built games, I've built mobile apps, I've built countless backends, I've built websites, and I currently do ops stuff (mostly Python, Terraform, and Docker). 

I currently use the following day to day:
- Terraform
- Python
- Docker

I've used the following languages and technologies in the past or currently on the side. The top is what I have the most experience in:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Angular
- React and NextJS
- Go
- Swift

I also used to do game dev! I've used Java (libGDX) and C# (Unity)!

My focus is on DevOps and one day I'd like to end up doing hardware programming.
